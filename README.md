# Outline
  * This repository contains programs built on the foundations of recursions and backtracking. I completed these programs while learning about the same.
  * The nqueens.py is a program that prints all possible combinations of the famous NQueens problem, see [8 Queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) for any user-inputted N.
  * The sudoku.py is a sudoku solver that recursively works through a defined sudoku board and completes the board, printing the result.
  * The sudoku_gui code is interesting as it uses the Tkinter GUi to display the board as it solves, allowing for the user to observe how the board evolves over time and fully understand the backtracking algorithm.

# Purpose
  * These engaging projects helped me truly understand the value of a seemingly complex topic; recursion and helped me fully learn through some of my favourite puzzles. These projects introduced me to new libraries such as numpy and tkinter, which I have since become wholly more proficient in.
